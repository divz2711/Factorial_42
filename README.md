AIM:
To create a two screens , first screen will take one number input from user. After click on Factorial button, second screen will open and it should display factorial of the same number using Explicit Intents.

EQUIPMENTS REQUIRED:
Latest Version Android Studio

ALGORITHM:
Step1:Start the application.

Step2:Create the first screen layout with the following components:
       Number input field.
      "Factorial" button.
      
Step3:Create the second screen layout to display the factorial result.

Step4:Define an event listener for the "Factorial" button.

Step5:When the "Factorial" button is clicked:

Step6:Retrieve the input value from the number input field.

Step7:Convert the input value to an integer.

Step8:Calculate the factorial of the input number.

Step9:Store the factorial result in a variable.

Step10:Create an explicit intent to open the second screen.

Step11:Attach the factorial result as an extra data to the intent.

Step12:Start the second screen activity using the intent.

Step13:In the second screen activity:

     Retrieve the extra data (factorial result) from the intent.
     Display the factorial result on the screen.
     
Step14:End the algorithm
